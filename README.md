# DecisionWheel
Graphical decision wheel, to decide where to go to lunch

To use: Edit the "decisionlist" in pythonball.pyw to include the desired choices. Inputting fewer than 8 choices will result in "Free Spaces" being added as placeholders. Inputting greater than 8 choices will result in the program eliminating choices at random before placing them on the wheel to reach a total of 8.
